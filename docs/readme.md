# What's this?
Pix 95 is an in browser recreation of Windows 95 (c) Microsoft 1995-2025.
Not only that, it's specifically designed for <i>you</i>, the programmer!
I've done my best to make app developement in this project as easy as it can be.

# How can I use this?
<i>this section under construction</i>

# What is this for?
You can use this for anything you want.
You could make a personal website where everything is an app, you could develop games for this, and you could even try to develop this project further into a full blown mock OS with every feature you could want!

# Can I sell what I make with this?
You may not sell any code from Pix 95 itself, but you can absolutely sell any apps you make for it.
And try to tell me about anything you make, I'd love to see what it can do!

# Why did you make this?
I'll be honest, I really don't know.

# Can you add [insert feature]?
If there's a specific feature you'd like to request, just ask!

# Lemme see!
