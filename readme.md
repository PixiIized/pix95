# Pix 95
Originally a remake of my personal website, this project has evolved.
It is now a (hopefully) easy to use tool that you can utilize to make (kind of) Windows 95.

# How To Use
Really incomplete right now, you can just make new windows with a few attributes.
Eventually, this will be a full fledges Windows 95 recreation in the browser.
I myself will be using it to make my website and all the info about me just <i>be</i> Windows 95.

# Progress
Very little

# Lemme See!
